        <h1>Introduction</h1>
        <p>
           I am a scurity consultant trying to understand the vulnerabilities in the ride hailing app. The application
           records the location of the user and finds the closest vehicle to them. To do this not only does it 
           store the passenger data but also the vehicle data. 
        </p>

        <h2>Methodology</h2>
        <p>
            I used white box testing to look for coding vulnerabilities. I looked through the code to see
            potential places where there could be then confirmed it using burp suite.
        </p>

        <h2>Abstract of findings</h2>
        <p>
            There is a lot of vulnerabilities in this application. Most of which hackers are able to 
            look at the data for each passenger and vehicles without proper authorization. This is a huge
            security risk as the app keeps track of a person's login and where they logged in from using
            longitude and laitude. There's also not a proper authorization technique to check if users 
            are allowed to even ask for data.
        </p>

        <h2>Issues: </h2>
        <blockquote>
            <h3>Issue 1</h3>
            <li>Issue = DataBase injection</li>
            <li>Location = /vehicle.json</li>
            <li>Severity of issue: High, the user can get a hold of all the vehicle data including the lat and lng which is high risk</li>
            <li>Description of issue: The code uses sql statement and inserts a where clause using user input without validating, filtering, or sanitizing to it</li>
            <li>Proof of vulnerability. Please see the code for GET /vehicle.json</li>
            <li>Resolution. Use prepared statements</li>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <h3>Issue 2</h3>
            <li>Issue = DataBase injection</li>
            <li>Location = /passenger.json</li>
            <li>Severity of issue: High, the user can get a hold of all the passenger data including the lat and lng which is high risk</li>
            <li>Description of issue: The code uses sql statement and inserts a where clause using user input without validating, filtering, or sanitizing to it</li>
            <li>Proof of vulnerability: Please see the code for GET /passenger.json</li>
            <li>Resolution. Use prepared statements</li>
        </blockquote>

        <blockquote>
            <h3>Issue 3</h3>
            <li>Issue = Does not have list of usernames</li>
            <li>Location = POST /rides</li>
            <li>Severity of issue: High, anyone can add data to the table </li>
            <li>Description of issue: There is no restrictions on who could add data to the table. Plus this means anyone could also check all the passenger and vehicle data </li>
            <li>Proof of vulnerability. Screenshots are important.</li>
            <li>Resolution: add a list of usernames that are allowed to add to the database</li>
        </blockquote>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>
            The application has some work to do. Things like adding prepared statements for username or password.
            Or just adding any sanitization for all user inputs will greatly help this application. An addition 
            of a list of authorized users would also be very beneficial for the app as it won't allow random 
            hackers to add or see the database. These are very important steps to take because this application
            stores location data of users and timestamps of it. This is very scary as anyone can take advantage
            of this and stalk people or do even worser things. I strongly recommend a rebuild of this application
            with keping the suggested changes in mind.
